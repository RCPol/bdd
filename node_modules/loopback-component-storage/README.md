# LoopBack Storage Component

**NOTE: The loopback-component-storage module supersedes [loopback-storage-service](https://www.npmjs.org/package/loopback-storage-service). Please update your package.json accordingly.**

LoopBack storage component provides Node.js and REST APIs to manage binary contents
using pluggable storage providers, such as local file systems, Amazon S3, or
Rackspace cloud files. We use [pkgcloud](https://github.com/pkgcloud/pkgcloud) to support the cloud based
storage services including:

- Amazon
- Rackspace
- Openstack
- Azure

> Please see the [Storage Service Documenation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Storage+component).
